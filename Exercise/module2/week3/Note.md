Assumsion $X$ have features independent with each other $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, to classificated $X$ into class c in $C = c_1, c_2, ..., c_m$, follow Bayes equation we have:

$$
P(c|X) = \frac{P(X|c) \cdot P(c)}{P(X)}
$$

Based on the maximum posterior probability estimate (MAP) we get:

$$
P(c|X) \propto P(X|c) \cdot P(c)
$$

$$
P(c|X) \propto P(x_1|c) \cdot P(x_2|c) \cdots P(x_n|c) \cdot P(c)
$$
